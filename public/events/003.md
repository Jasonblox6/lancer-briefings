# Mesto - Core Level // 7.29.5016u

After informing you that his ship was docked at an illegal Core-Level ship hanger, you followed **SYLAS MORGAN** down further into **MESTO**. You felt you were being watched.

The immediate temperature rise was felt by all members, and you noticed your comm-link also lost all signal down here.

**SYLAS** led you first to a Mech workshop, where you printed your new Mechs after assigning a License Level. He suggested you suit up in case of any complications.

As you began to lead **SYLAS** to his ship, several Mechs rushed out bearing insignia's of the **M.E.A**, and demanded you "hand over **SYLAS MORGAN** to them immediately".
