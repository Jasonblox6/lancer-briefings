# Planetary Defense Force HQ - Titan // 7.20.5014u

The Squad arrived at PDF HQ - a large facility on **SATURN'S** moon, **TITAN**. Here they were greeted by **LOR-ROK** and introduced to one another. They decided their unit would be known as **C.O.C.K - Cosmic Ordnance Committee Killers**, led by **LOR-ROK**

**LOR-ROK** led you around the Mech Workshop within the facility, and helped each of you to design a template for your LL0 **GMS EVEREST** Mechs. He then showed you his own mech - an **IPS-N Drake** - which he calls "The Dome".

After designign your mechs, an alarm began to blare across the facility. **LOR-ROK** tapped a device on his arm, stopping the alert and bringing up a hologram display of a distress call on **ZARBUL IV** - a small planet within **THE KARAKOAM-LINE**. An NHP voice indicated that they had been having issues near one of their Mech Workshops and required assistance. **LOR-ROK** introduced you to **C.O.C.K's** last member, an NHP named **PHOEBE**.

# C.O.C.K Spaceship - Cerro Bonete Blink Gate // 7.20.5014u

A few hours later, the squad were waiting in queue to blink to **ZARBUL IV**. Meanwhile, **LOR-ROK** showed you around the ship and allowed you to prepare from the wide array of supplies on offer.

After an hour or two of waiting in queue, you finally arrived at the **BROAD PEAK BLINK GATE**. From here you landed on **ZARBUL IV** and printed your Mechs before heading North to where reports of Mech disappearances had been originating from.
