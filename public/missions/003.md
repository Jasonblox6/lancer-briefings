# Mission // #002
## Mesto - Beta

Sylas Morgan is a Wanted man. However, he has the answers you need and so you've agreed to help him get to his ship, and off of Mesto.

# Goals
- Defend Sylas Morgan and successfully escort him to his ship, and extract from Mesto.

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, Sylas Morgan will be taken into custody, as well as any of you who do not manage to avoid capture. You may never get the answers you need from him.

# Reserves
- The members of C.U.M are at your disposal (2)
- Next downtime, Microwave can make an explosive for Dirty Bird, given they have specialised knowledge and a good workplace available.
